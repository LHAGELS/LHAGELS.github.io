## My Background
{: .text-justify}
I was born and grew up in the near of **Hamburg**, Germany. After the **Abitur** in 2014 (A-levels) I did a **two-years apprenticeship** in whole- and foreign sale at GARPA - Garten- und Park Einrichtungen GmbH. In 2016 I moved to **Konstanz** to attend the **B.Sc. Economics at the University Konstanz**. During my studies I took part of the **Erasmus+ programme** and studied a semester abroad in **Utrecht**, Netherlands and completed my studies in the first half of 2020. I am prospective Master student at the **Erasmus University Rotterdam** starting my studies in the field of **`Data Science & Marketing Analytics`** in 2020.  

This is my personal blog to keep track of my projects and different **HOWTOs related to Data Science as well as my recent experiences**.

One year ago (2019) I started a Data Science course on Coursera and began to understand the complexity of this emerging field. This is why I first focussed on my studies to finish my Bachelor-Thesis `Development Opportunities of Micro-Entrepreneurs: Evidence from Kenya` [Data Analysis with Stata](/portfolio/) and the subsequent **internship** in the Research & Development department of the **Mercedes Benz AG in Sindelfingen** (Content-Management S-/E-/C- and GLC -Class). Besides, I supported my former supervisor of the Bachelor-Thesis in **statistical analysis and data visualization** (with Stata) related to his current research paper. After finishing the Bachelor degree in Konstanz I returned to my Data Science journey (full-time) and completed several courses on Datacamp ([See Certificates](/certificates/)). I have acquired skills like **programming in Python and R, Machine Learning as well as Deep Learning techniques**. By my studies I am already **familiar with statistical modelling and testing** procedures.

Now, I am happy to join the Erasmus University in Rotterdam to gain more specific knowledge in Data Science.

**Keep track of my progress in the [Blog](/home/) or [Portfolio](/portfolio/) section.**

I am looking for job opportunities as Junior Data Scientist where I can help companies **optimize marketing and product development** by delivering actionable data insights using **Python and/or R** (or similar technologies). Since I am at the beginning of my career, I am looking forward to a **steep learning curve** and am always **ready to make the necessary effort!**

### Keywords:

Python (Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn),  Data Cleaning, Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, ANCOVA Regression, Classification, Clustering etc.), Probability/Statistics, Deep Learning (Keras).

I am ready to apply my Data Science skills to solve **Marketing, Sales, Logistic or Product problems** full-time as Junior Data Scientist.

## Hobbies
To balance the pressure of studying, I love to **go for a run or visit the gym**. Otherwise, I really love quiet places and surroundings to keep up with my current book.
