Part III of this series provides the process of sharing the gained insights with the audience. If you missed any previous part I advise you to catch up in [part I](https://lhagels.github.io/PART-I-Development-Opportunities-of-Micro-Entrepreneurs-Evidence-from-Kenya/) or [part II](https://lhagels.github.io/Part-II-Development-Opportunities-of-Micro-Entrepreneurs-Evidence-from-Kenya/)!

# Let's share our Wisdom with Policymakers!

## 4. Discussion
{: .text-justify}
The preceded analysis of micro-enterprise profit variations in Kenya raises interest in some major topics that should affect policy development.
Many women in developing countries have **problems to find work for wage**, are **forced to earn money** or simply try to **increase living standards** of their children. (World development report, 2012) Therefore a **distinction of women’s motivation** to start a micro-enterprise in developing countries should have been made. Sohn and Diez (2018) divided micro-enterprises into two groups: **necessity-driven** and **opportunity-driven**. Whereas necessity-driven entrepreneurs are more likely to operate in the informal sector.  
According to the World Development Report (2019) micro-enterprises in the **informal sector are more likely faced with problems** like **crime and poor infrastructure** what might negatively impact the efficiency in terms of **lacking access to clean water and electricity as well as transportation** possibilities. Therefore the implementation of the just mentioned standards should play a **key role in policy making** to revoke restrictions of micro-enterprises in developing countries.  
Abdo and Kerbage (2012) find NGO’s (**Non Governmental Organisations**) like the WED (**Women’s Entrepreneurship Development**) initiatives in Lebanon already provide assistance to **narrow the gap between the formal and informal sector** but often cannot keep promises that have been made. Nevertheless much work has to be done here. The scope of development aid should rather lie in **formalizing the informal sector** instead of only offering support programmes.  
Chen (2012) investigated advantages of formalizing the informal sector and lists not only infrastructure benefits like access to electricity and clean water but also possibilities to **transmit know-how** like formal **business associations** and further business **security aspects**.  
According to Pollin (2009) employment subsidies in the formal sector have **positive spill-over effects on the competitiveness** since less micro-enterprises compete with each other because necessity-driven female micro-entrepreneurs often prefer to work for wage. Plus micro-enterprises with at least one worker might be more flexible in future. Further Pollin investigated the **marginal and the general type of subsidies** concerning employment. The former supports only **new workers** of an enterprise whereas the latter is applied for **any worker** what seems to be very **costly but more efficient**. Micro-enterprises who employ at least one worker are found to yield higher profits. In other words, Mead and Liedholm (1998) found adding one worker increases a micro-enterprises’ likelihood to survive.  
The dataset of Dandora offers similar results. The **service sector’s** chance to employ workers is equal to **51%** at an **exit rate after treatment of only 1.4%** whereas **retailers** only have a chance of **12%** to employ workers at an **exit rate of 4.3%**.  
Regarding to further results, mentees in the street-food sector yield the highest profits followed by mentees in the retail sector. However, overall, the retail sector performs stable even under circumstances in which the otherwise strong street-food sector performs poorly, especially in low economic cycles. Therefore the **retail sector might be a suitable target group for approaches by the use of employment subsidies that may cause a pull effect for micro-enterprise vendors to shift from the informal to the formal sector**. As a result they may be faced with less constraints to **expand their business more sustainably**. In this context, the street-food sector might also be a suitable target group since major problems in this sector like lacks in storage possibilities and clean water access are closely associated with disadvantages of the informal sector.

## 5. Conclusion

Finally, the paper adds some new insights to the existing literature of micro-enterprises in developing countries.
Mentoring has high average treatment effects in the retail as well as in the street-food sector, while mentees in the service sector seem to benefit even negatively. However, the driver of this effect cannot be interpreted unambiguously thus further research should focus on this business sector to possibly validate the provided evidence by this paper regarding negative treatment effects in the service sector.  
The **salient group of mentees** in the street-food sector on average yields the highest profits. On the one hand, they **highly benefit from local expertise provided by mentors** as examined by Brooks et al. (2018) and therefore yield maximum average profits of 5096 KSh (**165% higher profits than the control group in the same sector**) in periods with **high economic activity**. On the other hand, they experience a **sharp decline in periods of low economic activity**. High **income elasticities of take-away food** have been interpreted as **partial driver of the contradictory effects**. Since the underlying dataset only contains one economic cycle it should be ensured that future research observes **several cycles** to confirm the **pro-cyclical variation of micro-enterprise profits**. Despite, first evidence of an ever repeating economic cycle has been elaborated in this paper.  
Other than street-food stalls, retailers sell **basic food** with an **income elasticity only half as high** as that of take-away food. Hence profits of retailers also decrease in periods of low economic activity but at a **lower degree**.  
As already described by Brooks et al. (2018) the class treatment on average does not record any particularly significant effects in profits among micro-enterprises. However, in the subgroup of retailers an average increase in profits equal to 12.6% has been detected but only at the 10% significance level while the effects are even negative within the service sector.  
Beyond the quantified absolute profits, **retailers have the highest chance to achieve profit growth** at the end of an economic cycle. At the same time this sector also still has **pending potentials** due to **low level employment** thus it is suggested to be an appropriate recipient of **development aid**.  
Recent literature investigated social learning in various contexts like mentoring or class trainings. However, **still unknown are possible effects by the transmission of information within networks** composed of differently treated micro-entrepreneurs. **A variation in the composition of treated participants may be interesting to indicate the effects of possible self-aid associations** on the development of micro-enterprises and determine the most efficient composition of those.
