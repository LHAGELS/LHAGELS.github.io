Part II of this series addresses the results we calculate with help of ANCOVA and Logistic Regression if you have missed the introduction make sure to stay tuned first and jump right into [part I](https://lhagels.github.io/PART-I-Development-Opportunities-of-Micro-Entrepreneurs-Evidence-from-Kenya/)! It may ease to follow the analysis.

# About Profits, Growth Rates and Elasticities
## 3. Results
In this section certain approaches are conducted to elaborate differences among micro-enterprises. An ANCOVA Regression is conducted to determine the **profit deviations of both treatment groups from the control group**. I do only summarize the main findings in this post

The received results are put into the **context of macroeconomic theory** to take possible externalities into account. Lastly, growth probabilities are determined in two different approaches. This enhances to **define a prospective target audiences for development policies**.

### 3.1. Differences among Business Sectors within Treatments
The data delivers slight evidence of ascending profits of the control, class and mentor treatment, respectively. Further the data suggests that **street-food micro-enterprises benefit particularly from mentoring**. Determinants and characteristics that differentiate this sector from others like **high competition** and the relevance of having a **unique market position** could be interpreted as **possible driver of this effect** as determined by Roy and Wheeler (2006).  
According to Brooks et al. (2018), successful entrepreneurs deliver local information to mentees who therefore achieve a better market position in contrast to participants of class trainings offered by a local university. Micro-enterprises in the **service sector** are suggested to even **benefit negatively from a class treatment** since the sign of its coefficient is negative and significant at the 1% level. In the mentor treatment the sign is also negative but its profit mean settles around the same values as it does in the control group thus it cannot be interpreted as significantly different.

### 3.2. Insights of Retail and Street-Food Sector
Subsequent to the comparison of profit differences among business sectors within treatment groups a more detailed view will follow in this section. Further insights of the **profit compositions over time** are given for the **retail and street-food sector** since sufficient evidence has been shown to assume them differently. Moreover, the profits are disaggregated by treatment groups.

### 3.2.1. Retail Sector

    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ sitebaseurl }}/assets/images/posts/04_06_20/figure2.png" alt="Profits: Retail Sector">
  </figure>
</center>

{: .text-justify}
The Retail sector experienced average profits of 1841 KSh over the period of 17 months after the treatment. Whereas the **class group reaches 233.2 KSh higher** profits (= 2074.2 KSh) (significant at 10% level) and the **mentor group reaches 451.6 KSh higher** profits (= 2292.6 KSh) (significant at 1% level) **than the control group**. Both treatment groups do not differ significantly from each other. In the wave-by-wave approach the mentees have significantly higher profits than the control group in wave 1 (2106.4 KSh, 10% level), wave 4 (2484.3 KSh, 5% level) and wave 5 (3363.1 KSh, 5% level). A **substantial rise in profits of mentees is noticed from wave 2 until wave 5**. The class group rises in the same manner as the mentor group but on a lower level in each wave.   
Hence, other than mentoring, it is not significantly different from the control group in wave 5. Between wave 3 and wave 4 are contradictory trends of the treatments and the control group. The control group declines in profits by 15.5%. In contrast, the treatment groups incline significantly by 10% (Mentees) and 20% (Class).  
This **dynamic effect delivers first evidence of positive treatment effects** of both, class training and mentoring, **on profits of micro-enterprises in the retail sector**. (See Table 3)

### 3.2.2. Street-Food Sector

</center>

{: .text-justify}
The **control group** in the street-food sector has **average pooled profits of 1352 KSh** over the period of 17 months after the treatment. These are not significantly different from the class group but from mentees. The latter achieve on **average 1236 KSh higher profits** at a 1% significance level which is equal to an average treatment effect of **91.4% higher profits** compared to baseline. This doubling effect is predominantly caused by a **sharp rise of profits** beginning in wave 2 that is interrupted at the **maximum value of 5096 KSh in wave 5**.  
First, this implies a growth of about 3188 KSh since wave 2 which equals a **growth rate of 2.64**. Second, **mentees yield 3171 KSh significantly higher profits than the control group which is equal to higher profits of 164.7%**. The growing period lasts 5 months and is assumed to be a **high economic cycle** (as described in [part I](https://lhagels.github.io/PART-I-Development-Opportunities-of-Micro-Entrepreneurs-Evidence-from-Kenya/)) during which the **street-food sector is able to benefit in great parts**. Between wave 5 and wave 6 a sharp decline from 5096 KSh to only 1113 KSh occurred such that mentee profits settle around the control and class mean again. This **contradictory trend** delivers **evidence that mentees in the street-food sector respond particularly sensitive to changes in the economic activity**. In wave 7 mentor profits stay on the same level whereas both other groups increase by 650 KSh (= 50-60%). Thus mentees yield significantly lower profits than participants of the class and control group at the end of the observation period. (See Table 4)

### 3.2.3. Implications of Elasticities

{: .text-justify}
The latter results have shown **evidence of a sharp decrease in profits in the street-food sector**. Especially the **subgroup of mentees shrinks in profits** extremely and **settles around values of the same level** as the class and control group in wave 6 (12 months after treatment). Beyond, an **overall decline in profits** is recorded in the period between December and February. Hence, this period is suggested to be a **low economic cycle**, during which a **reduction of consumer spending** would be expected.  
However, this remarkable effect cannot solely be explained by lower spending behaviours. To further provide an interpretation approach for shrinking profits in the **street-food sector at a higher degree compared to the retail** it is made use of **income and price elasticities**.  
According to Andreyeva et al. (2010) **take-away food in the US** is characterised by the **highest positive price elasticity** among all food categories. More detailed they concluded the elasticity to be equal to 0.82 while the elasticities of **basic food is approximately half as high**. In other words, if the price increases (_decreases_) by 1%, the demand of take away food increases (_decreases_) by 0.82%. Moreover, Meade et al. (2011) concluded low-income rather than high-income countries to react more sensitively in their food consumption, to changes in income or food prices. In addition this responsiveness varies among different types of food whereas take-away food also records for the highest and basic food for the lowest price elasticity. Further they quantify the **income elasticity of food for the US equal to 0.35** while the **income elasticity in Kenya is suggested to be twice as high**. Beyond, Aladejimokun et al. (2015) determine take-away food consumption in developing countries as a **luxury good**.  
In other words, a good is defined as a luxury good if the consumption of this good increases (_decreases_) **over-proportionally** in response to a marginal increase (_decrease_) in **consumer income** (Breyer, 2004). Therefore, especially in low economic cycles the consumption of take-away food is going to decrease due to their higher elasticity of demand.  
In contrast, normal goods like basic foods have lower elasticities thus the consumer demand increased (_decreased_) by a lower degree during high economic activity (_low economic activity_).  
Recent studies deliver evidence that suggests **high income elasticities of take-away food in developing countries as partial drivers of the sharp decline in profits of street-food micro-enterprises**. In contrast, **retailers** in Kenya experienced **declines by a lower degree since they supply basic food rather than take-away food**. As mentioned above basic food is characterised by a lower income elasticity thus consumers rather avoid the consumption of take-away food than the consumption of basic food.

### 3.3. Growth Probabilities at the End of one Economic Cycle
**Logistic regression** is conducted to investigate differences in the likelihood of a grown profit among treatment groups. As examined previously an **economic cycle is suggested to be 12 months** in length.
First, **“average growth”** is defined by the difference between the profits at baseline and the **average yield profits from wave 1 until wave 6**, this is equal to a period of 12 months after the treatment. Second, the same analysis is conducted again but narrowed in the definition of profit growth. Now, growth is determined by **"point growth"**. Thus it investigates the likelihood of **profit growth after exactly 12 months** instead of the average value within this period.

### 3.3.1. Overview of Probabilities
Table 5 summarizes the likelihoods of groups within each sector. According to the “average” values, **mentees are most successful with exception of the mentees in the service sector** where no evidence of significant different probabilities has been found. Nearly **70% of mentees** who operate in the **street-food** sector record growths in **average profits** and therefore establish as the salient subgroup of micro-enterprises. **In contrast, this subgroup only reaches a probability of 22% with respect to the point approach**.
The growth probability of **mentees in the retail sector is equal to 62% in the average-approach** while **53% of mentees still experience a growth in the point approach** (see above, street-food sector =22%). This provides evidence that the **retail sector indicates as stable even under circumstances where the otherwise strong street-food sector performs poorly**.

Finally, we analysed the data and got convenient knowledge about treatment groups and their profits in each business sector.  
The first suggestion would be to aim the Street-Food sector when introducing development policies since they yield substantially high profits. But after investigating the growth rates of both Retail and Street-Food sector we find the **Street-Food sector only increasing in the short-run** thus the **"average growth rate"** might be **biased upwards**. When focussing the **"point growth rate"** we find the **Retail sector** to have a **higher growth rate than the Street-Food sector**. Therefore we conclude rather the **Retail sector to be stable** and therefore to be a great addressee of **development policies**.

{: .text-justify}
Lastly, we have to draw further conclusions from our analysis and discuss possible policy implications. Therefore, you should follow finish this journey of this series in [part III](https://lhagels.github.io/Part-III-Development-Opportunities-of-Micro-Entrepreneurs-Evidence-from-Kenya/).
